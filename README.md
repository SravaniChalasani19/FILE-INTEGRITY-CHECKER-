During my Cyber Security Internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I successfully completed four hands-on tasks focused on practical security concepts using Python. The first task was a File Integrity Checker, which uses SHA-256 hashing to monitor and detect any unauthorized changes in a file. The second task involved building a Web Application Vulnerability Scanner capable of identifying common security flaws like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by sending test payloads to user-provided URLs. In the third task, I developed a Penetration Testing Toolkit that includes a port scanner to find open ports on a network and a brute-force simulation module that tests login attempts using a wordlist. The fourth and final task was an AES-256 Encryption Tool that securely encrypts and decrypts files using the PyCryptodome library, ensuring data confidentiality. Throughout the internship, I used tools such as Python 3, Visual Studio Code, Notepad, and Python IDLE for development. Libraries like hashlib, requests, socket, and Crypto.Cipher were utilized to implement cryptographic functions, HTTP scanning, and network-based tasks. This internship enhanced my understanding of cybersecurity principles, including data integrity, encryption, network vulnerabilities, and ethical hacking techniques, while strengthening my practical skills in secure coding and script-based automation.
